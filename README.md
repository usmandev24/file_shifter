File Shifter is a local web server for transferring and streaming files between devices on a LAN. It is implemented using only Node.js core modules and HTTP — no Express, no WebSocket libraries — and serves as an educational project to explore how request parsing, streaming, and related internals work.

## Features

### 1. Direct File Sending
- Send files directly to the main (server) PC.
- Pause / Resume support for each file transfer.
- Real-time progress and transfer speed indicators for each file operation.
- Chunk-based upload system for reliable resumable transfers.

### 2. Live Sending Mode
- Live streaming to any connected device using the server as a relay.
- Recipients can access files while they are being uploaded (streamed).
- Pause / Resume is not supported in live mode (continuous relay).
- Intended for testing streaming and relay behavior over HTTP.

### 3. QR Integration
- QR code generation for quick access; QR displayed in both terminal and web UI.
- Server link/URL updates when the network IP or server session changes.

### 4. Windows Installer
- Includes `install.ps1` that automates Node.js and package installation and prepares the app for immediate use.
- Installer generates `app.ps1`, which is the recommended launcher for regular use.

## Technical overview

- Language: Node.js (no frameworks)
- Protocol: HTTP
- Core concepts implemented manually:
  - HTTP request parsing
  - Body parsing for form and binary uploads
  - Cookie parsing and handling
  - URL parsing and routing
  - Stream-based file I/O and chunked transfers
  - Device Identity verification.
- Frontend: HTML5 + Vanilla JavaScript + Tailwind CSS.
- Installer: PowerShell script (`install.ps1`)
- **Purpose: Educational** — to implement and observe how Express-like features operate at a lower level

## Installation & usage
